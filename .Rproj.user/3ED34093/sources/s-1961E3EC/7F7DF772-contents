            I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC San Diego 
            and a researcher at the Salk Institute. I am interested in
            bioinformatics, machine learning, and genomics. Outside of work,
            I enjoy running, playing the guitar, and playing tennis. I am also
            an avid 49ers fan!
